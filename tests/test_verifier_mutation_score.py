"""Verifier mutation-score: the non-saturable measure of the engine's own anti-cheat.

csdd_score saturates at 1.0 once every principle is implemented+clean. The honest
non-saturable counter is the VERIFIER's strength: how much of a cheater's fake guard it
refuses to bless. The naive regex core cannot yet tell a dead stub or a comment-only
pattern from a real guard, so the score is honestly <1.0 — that gap is the point.
